# ðŸ”§ Reliability Maintenance Optimization with Weibull Modeling

This project applies data science techniques to analyze component reliability and optimize maintenance scheduling using both survival analysis and cost simulations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on time-to-failure data
- Fit Weibull models (including stratified by batch or group)
- Visualize Kaplan-Meier survival curves
- Calculate reliability and hazard functions
- Estimate MTTF (Mean Time To Failure)
- Optimize maintenance scheduling based on cost vs. reliability

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

A sample dataset (`EXA1.csv`) contains:
- `Time`: Time to failure or censoring
- `Event`: 1 = failure, 0 = censored
- `Group`: Component batch (optional for stratification)
